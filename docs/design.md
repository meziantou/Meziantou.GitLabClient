- Easy to use implementation
    - Based on HttpClient
    - No breaking change when adding a new parameter for an API resource
        - Use a class for the query parameters
        - Extension methods for usage simplicity
    - Use Nullable Reference Types
    - Support multiple parameter types (such as int or string for project id)
    - Allow accessing all properties using dynamic
    - Serialize to json without losing information
    - XML docs are set from the GitLab doc when possible

- Testable
    - Use GitLab docker image to validate the client (can be tested against multiple version)
    - Response mapping should be validated (good type / required properties / missing properties)
    - What about the license? (we can generate a trial on the fly but I think we can do better)
    - We can test as admin if needed

- The client cannot be generated from the documentation
    - No swagger file
    - Documentation format is inconsistent
    - Responses are examples (sometimes wrong) and sometimes are invalid JSON
